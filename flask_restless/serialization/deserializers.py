"""Classes for deserialization of JSON API documents to SQLAlchemy.

The abstract base class :class:`Deserializer` can be used to implement
custom deserialization from JSON API documents to SQLAlchemy
objects. The :class:`DefaultDeserializer` provide some basic
deserialization as expected by classes that follow the JSON API
protocol.

The implementations here are closely coupled to the rest of the
Flask-Restless code.
